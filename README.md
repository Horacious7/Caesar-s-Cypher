# Caesar Cipher Decryption Program

This program decrypts messages encoded using the Caesar cipher. It provides a user-friendly menu for decrypting messages and exiting the program.

## Features

- Decrypts messages encrypted using the Caesar cipher.
- Uses frequency analysis to determine the most likely shift key for decryption.
- User-friendly menu for easy interaction.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

   ```
   g++ caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar_cipher
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:

   ```
   ./caesar_cipher
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to either decrypt a message or exit the program.

## Files

- `caesar_cipher.cpp`: Contains the source code for the Caesar cipher decryption program.
- `distribution.txt`: Contains the frequency distribution of letters in English alphabet, used for frequency analysis.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries
